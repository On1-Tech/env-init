Bring IDE experiance to VIM

VIM configuration to bring IDE experiance out of the box for VIM 7.4 and above.
Works with Vundle Plugin Manager only. For other plugin managers you need to tweak vimrc file

## Requirements 
You need to create basic directory structure. To enable Vundle support do below:
```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle ~/.vim/backup ~/.vim/tmp
```

Also source vimrc. To do for Vundle put below into your ~/.vimrc
```
let custom_config_file = '~/.vim/bundle/ide.vim/vimrc'
exe 'source' custom_config_file
```

## Installation
Download project into your plugin manager source path
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/run2cmd/ide.vim.git
vim ~/.vimrc
```
